# SAMCares: An Adaptive Learning Hub
Powered by LLaMa2 of Meta, we developed a RAG system that will assist students in their Studies (a study buddy). The tool will be used to perform a trial to see if LLM helps students grasp course contents better than traditional means. 

# Running the code
Run the program using the following code:
chainlit run SAMCares.py

This assumes you have "chainlit" installed on your computer.

# Necessary Libraries and Dependencies
Use the "environment.yml" file to restore the exact libraries and use the version to run the SAMCares file.

# Notes:
The accompanying paper that outlines the trial can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00330
